# View Plot on Map - Implementation Summary

## What's Been Implemented

### 1. Enhanced Plot View Navigation (`handleViewDetails`)
**File**: `frontend/src/app/admin/cemetery/plots/page.tsx`

- Comprehensive plot data collection and storage
- URL parameter generation with all plot details
- Dual storage (localStorage + sessionStorage) for reliability
- Router navigation to cemetery map with focus parameters
- Debug logging for troubleshooting

### 2. Cemetery Map Focus System
**File**: `frontend/src/app/admin/cemetery-map/page.tsx`

- URL parameter parsing (`useSearchParams`)
- Focus plot data retrieval from multiple sources
- Initial map view configuration based on plot coordinates
- Conditional rendering: focused plot view vs. standard cemetery creation

### 3. Interactive Plot Marker System
**File**: `frontend/src/app\admin\cemetery-map\CemeteryMapComponent.tsx`

- Custom plot marker with status-based colors
- Animated pulse effect for focused plot
- Rich popup with plot information
- Marker positioning based on GPS coordinates
- Integration with existing map controls

## Key Features

### 🎯 **Precise Plot Location**
- Maps to exact GPS coordinates (lat/lng)
- High zoom level (18) for detailed view
- Animated marker for visual prominence

### 📋 **Comprehensive Plot Info**
- Plot number, section, block details
- Status with color coding (vacant/occupied/reserved/blocked)
- Occupant or reservation information
- Exact coordinates display

### 🗺️ **Full-Screen Map Experience**
- Dedicated focused plot view
- Clean header with plot information
- Back navigation and plot management links
- Satellite imagery for detailed terrain view

### 🔄 **Reliable Data Flow**
```
Plot Management Page → Storage → URL Parameters → Map Page → Marker Display
```

## How It Works

### Step 1: User Clicks "View on Map"
```typescript
handleViewDetails(plot) → stores plot data → navigates to map
```

### Step 2: Cemetery Map Loads
```typescript
useEffect() → reads URL params → loads focus data → configures map
```

### Step 3: Map Displays Focused Plot
```typescript
CemeteryMapComponent → renders marker → shows popup with details
```

## Status-Based Marker Colors
- 🟢 **Vacant**: Green (`#10b981`)  
- 🔴 **Occupied**: Red (`#ef4444`)
- 🟡 **Reserved**: Yellow (`#f59e0b`)
- ⚫ **Blocked**: Gray (`#6b7280`)

## URL Structure
```
/admin/cemetery-map?plotId=123&lat=14.6760&lng=121.0437&zoom=18&focus=true&section=A&block=1&plotNumber=SEC-A-BLK-1-LOT-001
```

## Data Flow Security
- Uses both localStorage and sessionStorage
- Automatic cleanup after focus completes
- URL encoding for special characters
- Fallback for missing data

## User Experience
1. **One-click navigation** from plot list to exact location
2. **Visual plot identification** with animated marker
3. **Detailed plot information** in popup
4. **Easy return** to plot management
5. **Same-tab navigation** for better workflow

## Testing the Feature
1. Go to Cemetery Plot Management (`/admin/cemetery/plots`)
2. Click "View on Map" on any plot
3. Should navigate to focused map view with:
   - Plot marker at exact location  
   - Plot details in header
   - Interactive popup on marker click
   - High zoom level for detail

## Browser Console Output
When clicking "View on Map", you'll see:
```
Viewing plot details: {id, plotNumber, coordinates, ...}
Storing focus plot data: {enhanced plot data}
Navigating to: /admin/cemetery-map?plotId=...
```

The implementation provides a seamless experience for users to quickly locate and view any cemetery plot on an interactive map with detailed information and precise positioning.
