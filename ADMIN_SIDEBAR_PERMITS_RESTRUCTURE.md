# AdminSidebar - Permits Restructure

## ✅ Update Completed

### Changes Made

Restructured the **Cemetery & Burial Management** section to make **"All Permits"** a parent menu item with three permit types as submodules.

## New Hierarchy Structure

```
Cemetery & Burial Management
├── Dashboard
├── Death Registrations
├── All Permits ⭐ (NEW PARENT)
│   ├── Permits Dashboard       → /admin/permits
│   ├── Burial Permits          → /admin/permits/burial
│   ├── Exhumation Permits      → /admin/permits/exhumation
│   └── Cremation Permits       → /admin/permits/cremation
├── Certificate Requests
├── Create Cemetery
├── Manage Cemeteries
└── Plot Management
```

## Before vs After

### ❌ Before (Flat Structure)
```
Cemetery & Burial
├── Dashboard
├── Death Registrations
├── All Permits              ← Single level
├── Burial Permits           ← Single level
├── Exhumation Permits       ← Single level
├── Cremation Permits        ← Single level
├── Certificate Requests
├── ...
```

### ✅ After (Nested Structure)
```
Cemetery & Burial
├── Dashboard
├── Death Registrations
├── All Permits              ← Parent
│   ├── Permits Dashboard    ← Child (formerly "All Permits" link)
│   ├── Burial Permits       ← Child
│   ├── Exhumation Permits   ← Child
│   └── Cremation Permits    ← Child
├── Certificate Requests
├── ...
```

## Technical Implementation

### Data Structure
```typescript
{
  id: "permits-overview", 
  label: "All Permits", 
  icon: MdAssignment,
  children: [
    { 
      id: "permits-dashboard", 
      label: "Permits Dashboard", 
      href: "/admin/permits", 
      icon: MdDashboard 
    },
    { 
      id: "burial-permits", 
      label: "Burial Permits", 
      href: "/admin/permits/burial", 
      icon: FiUsers 
    },
    { 
      id: "exhumation-permits", 
      label: "Exhumation Permits", 
      href: "/admin/permits/exhumation", 
      icon: FiClipboard 
    },
    { 
      id: "cremation-permits", 
      label: "Cremation Permits", 
      href: "/admin/permits/cremation", 
      icon: FiTrendingUp 
    }
  ]
}
```

### Navigation Levels
- **Level 1**: Cemetery & Burial (Green gradient when active)
- **Level 2**: All Permits (Orange gradient when active)
- **Level 3**: Individual permit types (Light green gradient when active)

---

## Visual Design

### Color Coding by Level
```css
Level 1 (Parent):
- Active: Green gradient (#4CAF50 → #45a049)
- Border: green-500/30

Level 2 (Child):
- Active: Orange gradient (#FDA811 → #E6951A)
- Border: orange-500/30

Level 3 (Grandchild):
- Active: Light green gradient (#66BB6A → #4CAF50)
- Border: None (deepest level)
```

### Indentation
```
0px   - Level 1 (Main items)
16px  - Level 2 (Children) + 12px padding + 2px border
40px  - Level 3 (Grandchildren) + 12px padding + 2px border
```

---

## Features

### ✅ Auto-Expansion
- When a user navigates to any permit page, the system automatically:
  1. Expands "Cemetery & Burial"
  2. Expands "All Permits"
  3. Highlights the active permit type

### ✅ Visual Indicators
- **Left Accent Bar**: Shows on active items (white bar)
- **Gradient Border**: Colored left border on expanded sections
- **Hover Effects**: Smooth background transitions
- **Icon Highlighting**: Active icons appear in white
- **Collapse/Expand Arrows**: Chevron icons indicate state

### ✅ Responsive Behavior
- When sidebar is collapsed, shows only Level 1 icons
- When sidebar is expanded, shows all levels with proper nesting
- Smooth transitions between states
