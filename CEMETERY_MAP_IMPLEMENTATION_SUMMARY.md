### Frontend Components
```
/frontend/src/app/admin/cemetery-map/
â”œâ”€â”€ page.tsx                    # Main cemetery map management page
â”œâ”€â”€ CemeteryMapComponent.tsx    # Interactive map component
â””â”€â”€ enhanced-page.tsx          # Enhanced workflow (reference)
```

### Backend APIs
```
/frontend/src/app/api/
â”œâ”€â”€ cemetery-layout/route.ts    # Cemetery layout CRUD
â”œâ”€â”€ cemetery-sections/route.ts  # Sections management
â”œâ”€â”€ cemetery-blocks/route.ts    # Blocks management
â””â”€â”€ cemetery-plots/route.ts     # Plots management (existing)
```

### Database Schema
```sql
CemeteryLayout (1) â†’ (many) CemeterySection â†’ (many) CemeteryBlock â†’ (many) CemeteryPlot
```

- Plot capacity configuration
- Visual drawing tools
- Color customization

### Step 5: Plot Generation
- Automated grid-based plot generation
- Configurable plot dimensions
- Pricing setup per plot
- Orientation settings
- Accessibility options
- Batch generation for all blocks

### Step 6: Review & Complete
- Complete summary of created elements
- Statistics overview
- Direct navigation to plot management
- Final validation and completion
